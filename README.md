Snake_3D

To compile this game you are going to need the freeglut-devel, and OpenGl packages. Simply type "make" while being in the root directory.

The game is simple, grab the red fruit as many times as you can without running out of the arena, hitting your blue self, or the green obstacles. The snake is guided by the arrow keys.
